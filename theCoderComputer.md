What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

What features should you look for in a text editor?
1.) code completion
2.) syntax highlighting
3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them


A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine

Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the tex

Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer

Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different
names


 Third-Party Options
 Let’s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today


NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only

TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to download it from the Mac App Store

BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-
day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free
version

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers

Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows
computers, Mac computers and Linux computers

Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for
Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers

Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full
for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a
history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well

The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
