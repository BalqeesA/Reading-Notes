
## Images
There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.
There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more attractive and professional.

You can also use CSS to include images in your pages using the background-image property.

#### Choosing Images for Your Site
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

####  Images
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
src
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.

alt
This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

height
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

width
This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

## Where to Place Images in Your Code
Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:

1: before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

2: inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3: in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.


## Color
Color can really bring your pages to life.

### Foreground Color

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

color names 
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan.

### Understanding Color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. Understanding Color Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).

RGB Values
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

Hex Codes
Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.

Color Names
Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.

Hue
Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.

Saturation
Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.

Brigh tness
Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.

## Text
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

●●Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

●● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters).
The formatting of your text can have a significant effect on how readable your pages are. As we look through these properties I will also give you some design tips on how to display your type.

### Typeface Terminology
Serif
Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

Monospace
Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)

### Choosing a Typeface for your Website
When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.
