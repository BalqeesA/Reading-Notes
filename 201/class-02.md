When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page. In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages.

# Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface. Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS mostly involves learning the different properties you can use

# Basic Javascript instructions 

you will start learning to read and write JavaScript. You will also learn how to give a web browser instructions you want it to follow.

## THE LANGUAGE:
SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR like any new language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and rules for how these can be put together (the grammar and syntax of the language)

## GIVING INSTRUCTIONS:
FOR A BROWSER TO FOLLOW Web browsers (and computers in general) approach tasks in a very different way than a human might. Your instructions need to reflect how computers get things done.

## STATEMENTS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

## COMMENTS
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

## VARIABLE
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. When you write JavaScript, you have to tell the interpreter every individual step that you want it to perform. This sometimes involves more detail than you might expect.

# Decision & Loops

Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. In this chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations.

Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:

### EVALUATIONS
You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results.

### DECISIONS
Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down

### LOOPS
There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.
