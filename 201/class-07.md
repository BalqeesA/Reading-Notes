
## Tables
There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables. When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a spreadsheet)

### What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format.
Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

### Basic Table Structure

#### table>
The table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

#### tr>
You indicate the start of each row using the opening tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more td> elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing tr> tag.



#### td>
Each cell of a table is represented using a td> element. (The td stands for table data.)

#### th>
The th> element is used just like the td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table
heading.) Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a td> or th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly. (The first cell in the first row of this example shows an empty cell.)
