JavaScript & jQuery

## In order to teach you about creating web pages, this book is divided into three sections:

1: HTML
HTML is used to create web pages You will see that you start by writing down
the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on.

2: CSS
CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your
CSS rules. These properties generally fall into one of two categories:
* Presentation: How to control things like the color of text

* Layout: How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen.

3: Practical
We look at some new tags that will be introduced in HTML5 to help describe the structure of your pages. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML (still under development at the time of writing). Before learning about these elements, you need a good grasp of how CSS is used to control the design of web pages. There is a chapter that talks you through a design process that you might like to follow when creating a new website.

## Before we look at the code used to build websites it is important to consider the different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology.

Browsers
People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

Web Servers
When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.

Screen readers
Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.

Devices
People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. It is important to remember that various devices have different screen sizes and some have faster connections to 
the web than others.

All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix

How it is Created
Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS. Larger websites — in particular those that are updated regularly and use a content management system (CMS), blogging tools, or e-commerce software — often make use of more complex technologies on the web server, but these technologies are actually used to produce HTML and CSS that is then sent to the browser

HT ML5 & CSS 3 Since the web was first created there have been several versions
of HTML and CSS — each intended to be an improvement on the previous version.

How the Web Works
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## How Pages use Structure
The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.

Structuring Word Documents
The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information.

HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages
In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.

## HTM L Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags

## Links
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. You will commonly come across the following types of links:
●●Links from one website to another
●● Links from one page to another on the same website
●● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
●● Links that open in a new browser window
●● Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it

## Linking to Other Sites
<a> other-sites.html HTML Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link. Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute. When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.
