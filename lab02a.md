## Reading Notes

What is the meaning of a growth mindset?
Growth Mindset: “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” ( Dweck, 2015)

Ways to Develop a Growth Mindset
1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.
Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them.

2. View challenges as opportunities.
Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement. 

3. Try different learning tactics.
There’s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you
